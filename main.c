/*
Exercise 3-4. In a two's complement number representation, our version 
of itoa does not handle the largest negative number, that is, the value of n 
equal to -(2wordsize-1). Explain why not. Modify it to print that value 
correctly, regardless of the machine on which it runs. 

Exercise 3-5. Write the function itob(n,s,b) that converts the integer n into a 
base b character representation in the string s. In particular, itob(n,s,16) 
formats s as a hexadecimal integer in s. 

Exercise 3-6. Write a version of itoa that accepts three arguments instead of 
two. The third argument is a minimum field width; the converted number must be 
padded with blanks on the left if necessary to make it wide enough.
